# paper2_matlab_scripts
Scripts used in my second research preoject which call Matlab scripts to perform machine learning models. 

In my masters thesis I was required to run a set of machine learning models on a dataset. There were 120 different models. Using bash scripts I was able to automate this task. Also the bash scripts where written to maintain 8 processes on the machine at all times (which was equal to the number of CPUs). Maintaing that many processes insured that there were always work for the CPUs without too much rescheduling.
